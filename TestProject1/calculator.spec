## Addition
Adding two numbers together should return the sum of the two numbers.
* "1"+ "1" = "2"
* "1"+ "2" = "3"
* "1"+ "3" = "4"
* "1"+ "4" = "5"
* "1"+ "5" = "6"

## Subtraction
Subtracting two numbers should return the difference of the two numbers.
* "1" - "1" = "0"
* "2" - "1" = "1"
* "3" - "1" = "2"
* "4" - "1" = "3"

## Multiplication
Multiplying two numbers should return the product of the two numbers.
* "1" * "1" = "1"
* "2" * "1" = "2"
* "3" * "1" = "3"
* "4" * "1" = "4"
* "4" * "4" = "16"

## Division
Dividing two numbers should return the quotient of the two numbers.
* "1" / "1" = "1"
* "2" / "1" = "2"
* "3" / "1" = "3"
* "4" / "1" = "4"
* "4" / "2" = "2"
